Tinder
Speed Dating with Tinder
Company's description 📇
Tinder is an online dating and geosocial networking application. In Tinder, users "swipe right" to like or "swipe left" to dislike other users' profiles, which include their photos, a short bio, and a list of their interests.

Tinder was launched by Sean Rad at a hackathon held at the Hatch Labs incubator in West Hollywood in 2012.

As of 2021, Tinder has recorded more than 65 billion matches worldwide.

Goals 🎯
Use the dataset to understand what makes people interested into each other to go on a second date together:

You may use descriptive statistics
You may use visualisations
Scope of this project 🖼️
Data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four minute "first date" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.

The dataset also includes questionnaire data gathered from participants at different points in the process. These fields include: demographics, dating habits, self-perception across key attributes, beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate, and lifestyle information. See the Speed Dating Data Key document below for details.
